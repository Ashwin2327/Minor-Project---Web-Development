    <h1 align="center">Historical Places of Spain</h1>
    <p>Spanish architecture refers to architecture in any area of what is now Spain, and by Spanish architects worldwide. Spanish architecture demonstrates great historical and geographical diversity, depending on the historical period.[1] It developed along similar lines as other architectural styles around the Mediterranean and from Northern Europe[citation needed], although some Spanish constructions are unique.</p>
<h2>El Escorial</h2>

<p>Intended to mark the celebration of Spain’s victory over the French in the Battle of St Quentin, El Escorial was constructed between 1563 and 1567 by Juan Bautista de Toledo, a Spanish architect who had spent much of his career in Rome. It would go on to serve as the king’s palace and the seat of his empire.</p>
<p>The basilica is the central part of the complex: look out for the gorgeous white Carrara marble statues and paintings by El Greco, amongst other 16th, 17th and 18th Spanish and Flemish artists.</p>
<h2>El Miguelete</h2>
<div align="center"><image src="Images/El Miguelete.jpg" height="500" width="500"></image></div> 
<p>El Miguelete (The Micalet Tower) is an iconic gothic bell tower built in 1381 and joined onto Valencia Cathedral in the 15th century. El Miguelete means ‘Little Michael’ and comes from the name of its biggest bell made in 1532 weighing over 10 tons.</p>
<p>Construction of the Valancian cathedral’s bell tower, El Miguelete, began in 1381 directed by master builder Andreu Julià of the Valencian Gothic style. The imposing design and size of the cathedral and bell tower reasserted Valencia’s Christian identity after Muslim dominance from the 8th to mid 13th century.However, it was El Miguelete’s complex design, including a helical stairwell and fine mouldings, that meant the tower took a long time to construct.</p>
<h2>Toledo Sephardic Museum</h2>

<p>The Toledo Sephardic Museum (Museo Sefardi) is a national museum dedicated to the history, culture and legacy of the city’s Jewish population.</p>
<p>From Roman times to the 15th century Jewish expulsion, the Toledo Sephardic Museum covers the long Jewish history in Spain. The building in which the Toledo Sephardic Museum is located was itself a part of this heritage, built as a synagogue in the 14th century. </p>
<h2>Seville Cathedral</h2>
<div align="center"><image src="Images/Seville Cathedral.jpg" height="500" width="500"></image></div> 
<p>Seville Cathedral is the third largest cathedral in the world, a World Heritage site and the resting place of colonial explorer, Christopher Columbus.An impressive gothic structure and, with a total area of 11,520 square metres, Seville Cathedral is only beaten in size by London’s St Paul’s Cathedral and Rome’s St. Peter’s. Some even argue that it is actually the largest when comparing volume.</p>
<p>Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, the cathedral is an incredible historic site where visitors can appreciate the sheer scale of the building from inside, including its central nave which stands at a grand forty metres high. With its ornate, gold-laden interiors and eighty chapels, the scale of Seville Cathedral alone is quite a sight, coupled with the wealth of architectural influences, ranging from Gothic and Baroque to Mudejar.</p>
<h2>Cordoba Roman Bridge</h2>

<p>Built by the Romans in the 1st century BC, the Roman Bridge of Cordoba, Spain, as described in around 1140 by Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, ‘surpasses all other bridges in beauty and solidity’.</p>
<p>Rather than simply an object of beauty which it undoubtedly is, the bridge was a vital player in the city of Cordoba’s battles with, amongst others, the ominously-named Peter the Cruel in the 1350s.</p>
